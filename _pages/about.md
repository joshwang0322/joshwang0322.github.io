I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/) at [Northwestern
University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) advised by Prof. [Chang-Han Rhee](https://chrhee.github.io/). 

Please find my CV [here](https://joshwang0322.github.io/files/XingyuWangCV2023Sep.pdf).

Research
======

Iâ€™m broadly interested in applied probability, machine learning theory, and stochastic simulation. In particular, my work focuses on the **heavy-tailed phenomenon** (i.e., extreme variability) in stochastic systems. Contrary to common belief, heavy tail is often the norm rather than an exception in significant applications in areas such as finance, large-scale networks, and the training of AI. My work develops mathemaical tools such as large deviations to rigorously characterize **how systems can deviate from expected behavior and how rare events manifest** under the presence of heavy tails. What's particularly surprising and valuable is that, based on knowledge of atypical behaviors (rare events), I can provide a **comprehensive characterization of the typical behaviors** (i.e., metastability) of the global dynamics (see [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03479.pdf)). Building upon such universal and powerful theories, I develop provably strong computational tools that can quantify, control, or even leverage the heavy-tailed phenomenon in modern algorithms and complex systems. For instance:
- My work [[2]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B3Nde6lvab) rigorously characterize a fascinating phenomenon where injecting and then truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase of deep neural networks can lead to improved generalization performance during the test phase.
- Our heavy-tailed large deviation theory can be applied to obtain a unified importance sampling scheme that is not only strongly efficient but also universarlly applicable to rare-event simulation tasks in a wide range of contexts; In [[3]](https://joshwang0322.github.io/files/WangRhee23b.pdf) we illustrate its application in the contexts of option pricing, stochastic approximation, and queuing systems; In [[4]](https://joshwang0322.github.io/files/WangRhee23a.pdf) we successfully extend the algorithm to address the particularly challenging cases where it is computationally infeasible to simulate or store the underlying process.
