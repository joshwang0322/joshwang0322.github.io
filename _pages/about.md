I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/) at [Northwestern
University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) advised by Prof. [Chang-Han Rhee](https://chrhee.github.io/). 

Please find my CV [here](https://joshwang0322.github.io/files/XingyuWangCV2023Sep.pdf).

<br/><br/>

I'm in the 2023-24 Academic Job Market
======

I will present my work "**Large Deviation and Metastability Analysis for Heavy-Tailed Dynamical Systems**" at the 2023 INFORMS annual meeting:
- George Nicholson Student Paper Competition
- TBD

I will present my work "**Eliminating Sharp Minima from SGD with Truncated Heavy-Tailed Noise**" at the 2023 INFORMS annual meeting:
- MC11. Large Deviations and Global Dynamics of Heavy-Tailed Systems
- October 16 (Mon), 12:45 PM - 2:00 PM,  CC-North 124A

I'm actively looking for junior faculty positions in engineering or business schools. My research interests align with the fields of **Operation Research and Industrial Engineering**.

Research
======

Iâ€™m broadly interested in applied probability, machine learning theory, and stochastic simulation. In particular, my work focuses on the **heavy-tailed phenomenon** (i.e., extreme variability). Contrary to common belief, heavy tail is often the norm instead of an exception in areas such as finance, large-scale networks, and the training of AI. My work develops mathemaical tools like large deviations to help understand **how systems can deviate from expected behavior and how rare events manifest** under the presence of heavy tails. What's particularly surprising and valuable is that, based on knowledge of atypical behaviors (rare events), I can provide a **comprehensive characterization of the typical behaviors** (i.e., metastability) of the global dynamics for heavy-tailed dynamics (see [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03479.pdf)). Building upon such universal and powerful theories, I develop provably strong computational tools that can quantify, control, or even leverage the heavy-tailed phenomenon in modern algorithms and complex systems. For instance,
- My work [[2]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B3Nde6lvab) rigorously characterize a fascinating phenomenon where injecting and then truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase of deep neural networks can lead to improved generalization performance during the test phase.
- We can propose a unified rare-event simulation algorithm that is not only strongly efficient but also universarlly applicable to a wide range of contexts, including mathematical finances, stochastic optimization, and queuing networks (see [[3]](https://joshwang0322.github.io/files/WangRhee23b.pdf)); this algorithm remains effective even in particularly challenging scenarios where it is computationally infeasible to simulate or store the underlying process (see [[4]](https://informs-sim.org/wsc20papers/034.pdf)).
